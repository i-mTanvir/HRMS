            <h2>Behind the success</h2>
            <p>
                RIPO started with a simple idea – making home service booking
                as easy as ordering food online. We are a young and motivated
                team that believes in reliable service, clear pricing and
                friendly support.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the past years, we have handled many AC, TV and fridge
                repair jobs across the city. Our goal is to connect you with
                verified professionals so you can relax while the work gets
                done safely and on time.
            </p>
            <p>
                We continue to improve RIPO every day to give both customers
                and service providers a fair, transparent platform to grow.
